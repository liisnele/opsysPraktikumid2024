## Praktikum 14 - Azure VM ja WSL

Azure Subscriptions are a logical unit of Azure services that are linked to an Azure account. In order to take advantage of Azure's cloud-based services, you must have a subscription as it serves as a single billing unit for Azure resources used in that account.
In Azure, a resource is an entity managed by Azure. Virtual machines, virtual networks, and storage accounts are all examples of Azure resources.
A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group can include all the resources for the solution, or only those resources that you want to manage as a group.
